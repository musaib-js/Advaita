Memories which both you and us , will cherish for a lifetime, but without the flavours of a variety of events these memories do seem a bit flavourless and thats is why we have a broad range of events from technical to robotics, from singing to dancing, from gaming to foos, just name it and we have it all covered!! So whats the wait for? Check out all these amazing events of which you can be a part and help in making our memories more pleasurable.</div>
